# C195Project: Java Scheduling Application
## Purpose
A scheduling program which interacts with a database to add, edit, and delete customers, to add, edit, and delete appointments, and to provide reports on the data in the database. 

The program first launches with a login form which validates users through the database. Once validated, the program informs the user of any appointments within 15 minutes of login time and then launches the main view which contains three tabs: Customer, Appointment, and Reports. 

The Customer tab contains a table view which lists all the customers and a form to edit existing customers and add new customers. 

The Appointment tab contains a table view which by default lists all the appointments in the current month, a form to edit existing appointments and add new appointments, and a toggle radio button which changes the table view to only display appointments in the current week. 

The Report tab contains a combo box which allows the user to choose reports. Choosing the report loads it onto the tab. If information has been changed, the user can click on the "Refresh" button to update the report.
### Additional Report
The additional report is called the Contact Hours Report. The report lists the number of hours each contact has scheduled for appointments for each month.
